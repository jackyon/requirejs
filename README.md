Requirejs base structure
==================================

This is just workflow structure for my base workflow.


Structure:
```bash
$ tree
.
|-- app
|   |-- build
|   |-- css
|   |-- images
|   |-- js
|   |-- index.html
|-- dist (only show after build)
```




Usage:

- build js/css

in terminal: build/build.sh
